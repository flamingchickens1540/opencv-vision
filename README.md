- Random stuff
  - Making versions 3.1.0 and 2.4.13 on macOS fails with the error `QTKit/QTKit.h file not found`
    - This appears to be due to a missing libary (QTKit), which has been deprecated by Apple since 10.9
    - This appears to be resolved by [PR 7266](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/7266), but no releases contain this update yet: use the latest version of branch master on GitHub for now.
  - On macOS, installing CMake from the provided default download does not install the `cmake` command.
    - On macOS, install CMake using Homebrew to remedy this
  - The Java components will not be built unless Apache Ant is installed and correctly configured
    - On macOS, the easiest way to install Ant is through Homebrew
